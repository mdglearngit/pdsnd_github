### Date created
Project created 2/2/22. (Really it was. Ok, was submitted that day.)

### Project Title
Bikeshare Usage

### Description
The Bikeshare Usage project enables users to see statistics about who is using the bikes available in Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C., as well as, how the riders are using the bikeshare service, e.g. most popular routes.

The program asks the user to input the city, month and day of week the user is interested in. After the general statistics are provided, the user can also ask to view the raw data.

[Adding more content here because I just noticed the section that said I needed at least 3 commits for the readme file. This is number 2.]

### Files used
Main program file: bikeshare.py
Data files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

### Credits
I'd like to give credit to the Udacity graders. i.e. YOU, reading this right now. Thank you for the work you do in helping those of us taking the classes to learn skills that we need to stay competitive in the job market. I am taking the class to make a career shift and your efforts are helping me do that. I hope you have a wonderful day.
